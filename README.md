This project was done as part of the course "CS 4400 - Introduction to Database Systems" course at Georgia Institute of Technology in the Fall 2022 semester.

This was a group project.

The project was separated into 3 different phases.
In Phase 1, we had to submit an enhanced entity-relationship diagram (EERD).
In Phase 2, we had to translate the EERD into a relational schema and create the database.
In Phase 3, we had to implement stored procedures and views.
